# Netlify config for plan-partner frontend

[build]
  command = "npm run build"
  publish = "dist"
  functions = "netlify/functions"

# Optional: set BACKEND_URL here (or in Netlify UI → Site settings → Environment variables)
# [build.environment]
#   BACKEND_URL = "http://YOUR_EC2_IP:3001"

# VITE_API_URL must be set in Netlify UI so the frontend calls the proxy (HTTPS) instead of the backend (HTTP)
# In Netlify: Environment variables → VITE_API_URL = /.netlify/functions/api
#             Environment variables → BACKEND_URL = http://13.233.110.45:3001
